Astro includes special handling to make writing CSS as easy as possible. You can use your favorite libraries, write your own css files, or take advantage of Astro's own scoped styling.

## Styling an Astro Component

Astro allows you to include both global and scoped styles right inside an Astro component. You can write plain CSS (or use a CSS language extension) directly in Astro's `<style>` tag to style your component.

By adding an [integration](/en/integrations/integration-guide) like Tailwind, you can also take advantage of writing utility classes inline in your Astro component template.


### Scoped Styles

Styling inside of Astro components is done by adding a `<style>` tag in the component template.

By default, all Astro component styles are **scoped**, meaning they only apply to the HTML elements written in the current component. Any HTML rendered via a child component import is **not** affected by the `<style>` tag unless you explicitly opt in to this styling.

```astro
---
// src/components/MyAstroComponent.astro
import ChildComponent from '../components/ChildComponent.astro';
---
<style>
  /* Scoped class selector within the component */
  .text {
    font-family: cursive;
  }
  /* Scoped element selector within the component */
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h1>I‚Äôm a scoped style and I‚Äôm red!</h1>
<p class="text">I'm a scoped style and I‚Äôm cursive!</p>

<!-- unaffected by styles in the `<style>` tag -->
<ChildComponent / > 

```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Child components are not affected by the styles tag by default, but there are ways to style them!

```astro
<!-- unaffected by styles in the `<style>` tag -->
<ChildComponent /> 

<!-- styled by the `<style>` tag -->

<div class="text">
  <ChildComponent /> 
</div>
```

#### Styling children

If you‚Äôd like scoped styles to apply to children, you can use the special `:global()` function borrowed from [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to specifically target **a class and all its descendents**:

```astro
---
// src/components/MyComponent.astro
import PostContent from './Post.astro';
---
<style>
  /* Scoped to current component only */
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }

  /* Scoped to all descendents of the scoped .blog-post class */
  .blog-post :global(h1) {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h1>Title</h1>
<article class="blog-post">
  <PostContent />
</article>
```

This is a great way to style things like blog posts, or documents with CMS-powered content where the contents live outside of Astro. But be careful: components whose appearance differs based on whether or not they have a certain parent component can become difficult to troubleshoot.

#### How does it work?

Astro's CSS scoping works by adding an extra class to every element, then re-writing selectors to require those classes as well.
  
For example, this code:
  
```astro
<h1>I am a red heading!</h1>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```
  
would be rendered to HTML using an Astro-specific class:
  
```html
<h1 class="astro-abc123">I am a red heading!</h1>

<style>
  h1.astro-abc123 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```
  
Most of the time you don‚Äôt need to worry about any of this, but it's good to keep in mind that an extra class is added to every element when you're writing global styles.
  
### Astro Global Styles

**(Current as of v0.25: `<style global>`)**
**(Coming soon: `<style is:global>`)**

To apply styles globally, without the need for a separate `.css` file or external stylesheet link, Astro allows you to use the `global` attribute on style declarations within any Astro component, page or layout. 

```html
<style global> /* Soon to be replaced with <style is:global> */
  /* Applies to all h1 tags in your entire site */
  h1 {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
</style>

<h1>Globally-styled</h1>
```

You can also style globally by using the `:global()` function at the root of a selector instead:

```html
<style>
  /* Applies to all h1 tags in your entire site */
  :global(h1) {
    font-size: 32px;
  }

  /* normal scoped h1 that applies to this file only */
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Styles marked as `global` in `<style>` tags apply throughout your entire project! 

It could be easy to lose track of which Astro component is defining styles globally, and harder to troubleshoot errant global styles when they are scattered around and not in a central CSS file. So, we suggest applying global styling via an import or `<link>` whenever possible.

### Variables in Styles

<Since v="0.21.0" />

_Serializable_ server-side variables can be passed into client-side `<style>` using `define:vars`.

```astro
---
// tick.astro
const foregroundColor = "rgb(221 243 228)";
const backgroundColor = "rgb(24 121 78)";
---
<style define:vars={{ foregroundColor, backgroundColor }}>
h-tick {
  background-color: var(--backgroundColor);
  border-radius: 50%;
  color: var(--foregroundColor);
  height: 15px;
  width: 15px;
}
</style>
<h-tick>‚úì</h-tick>
```

## External Styles

There are two ways to resolve external global stylesheets: an ESM import for files located within your project source, and an absolute URL link for files in your `public/` directory, or hosted outside of your project. 

üìö Read more about using [static assets](/en/guides/imports) located in `public/` or `src/`.


### Import a Global Stylesheet

Import a global stylesheet **at the top** of an Astro component script, using its relative file path, along with any other imports:

```astro
---
// Astro will include and optimize this CSS for you automatically
// This also works for preprocessor files like .scss, .styl, etc.
import '../styles/utils.css';

const title="My Astro Page"
---
<html><!-- Your page here --></html>
```

When a CSS file is imported using this method, any `@import` statements are also resolved and inlined into the imported CSS file.

Astro detects these CSS imports and then builds, optimizes, and adds the CSS to the page automatically. 

### Stylesheet Link

When your stylesheet is located in your `/public` directory, or when using a public stylesheet hosted offsite (e.g. a Prism theme), use a `<link>` tag with an absolute URL reference.

```html
<head>
  <!-- stylesheet located at /public/styles/global.css -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/global.css" />
  <!-- stylesheet hosted offsite -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs@1.24.1/themes/prism-tomorrow.css">
</head>
```

This approach skips the CSS processing, bundling and optimizations that are provided by Astro when you use the `<link>` method described above. These files will not be transformed.


## Integrations

Astro comes with support for adding popular CSS libraries, tools and frameworks to your project like PostCSS, Tailwind and more! 

üìö See the [Integrations Guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for instructions on installing, importing and configuring these integrations.


## CSS Preprocessors

Astro supports CSS preprocessors such as [Sass][sass], [Stylus][stylus], and [Less][less] through [Vite][vite-preprocessors].

### Sass

 ```
 npm install -D sass
 ````
 Use  `<style lang="scss">` or `<style lang="sass">` in `.astro` files

### Stylus

```
npm install -D stylus
``` 
Use `<style lang="styl">` or `<style lang="stylus">` in `.astro` files

### Less
```
npm install -D less
``` 
Use `<style lang="less">` in `.astro` files.


> You can also use all of the above CSS preprocessors within JS frameworks as well! Be sure to follow the patterns each framework recommends:

- **React** / **Preact**: `import Styles from './styles.module.scss'`;
- **Vue**: `<style lang="scss">`
- **Svelte**: `<style lang="scss">`

Additionally, [PostCSS](#postcss) is supported, but the setup is slightly different.


---

## Frameworks and Libraries

### üìò React / Preact

`.jsx` files support both global CSS and CSS Modules. To enable the latter, use the `.module.css` extension (or `.module.scss`/`.module.sass` if using Sass).

```js
import './global.css'; // include global CSS
import Styles from './styles.module.css'; // Use CSS Modules (must end in `.module.css`, `.module.scss`, or `.module.sass`!)
```

### üìó Vue

Vue in Astro supports the same methods as `vue-loader` does:

- [vue-loader - Scoped CSS][vue-scoped]
- [vue-loader - CSS Modules][vue-css-modules]

### üìï Svelte

Svelte in Astro also works exactly as expected: [Svelte Styling Docs][svelte-style].
